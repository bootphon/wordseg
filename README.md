### Please see the online documentation at https://wordseg.readthedocs.io


The wordseg package provides **a collection of tools for text based
word segmentation** covering both algorithms, evaluation and
statistics relevant for word segmentation studies.

The segmentation pipeline provided by wordseg is **command line
oriented**. We provide a set of useful commands for text preparation,
segmentation and evaluation than be used in conjunction to any other
bash utilities.

The wordseg commands are:

* **wordseg-prep** prepares a text in a phonological-like form for
  segmentation, basically removing word separators and checking format.

* **wordseg-gold** generates a gold text from a phonological one,
  replacing word separators by spaces.

* **wordseg-\<algorithm\>** computes word segmentation on a prepared
  text, outputting the text with word boundaries added. The algorithms
  available are ag, dibs, dpseg, puddle and tp.

* **wordseg-eval** evaluates a segmented text on a gold version,
  computing the precision, recall and f-score at type, token and
  boundary levels.

* **wordseg-stats** computes basic statistics on a segmented or gold
  text.
