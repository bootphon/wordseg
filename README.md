### Please see the online documentation at https://wordseg.readthedocs.io ###

The wordseg package provides **a collection of tools for text based
word segmentation** covering both text preprocessing, segmentation
algorithms, evaluation and statistics relevant for word segmentation
studies. It can be used from **bash** and **python**.


### Evaluation

Forked from bootphon's wordseg repo and updated with a new evaluation script in order to run type scoring alongside token and boundary scoring.
