on master branch (not yet released)
-----------------------------------

* Features

    * New methods for basic statistics and normalized segmentation
      entropy in **wordseg-stats**

    * New forward/backward option in **wordseg-tp**.

    * New command **wordseg-baseline** that produces a random
      segmentation given the probability of a word boundary.

    * New command **wordseg-syll** estimates syllable boundaries on a
      text using the maximal onset principle. Exemples of onsets and
      vowels files for syllabifications are given in the directory
      `data/syllabification`.

    * For citation purposes a DOI is now automatically attached to
      each wordseg release.

* Bugfixes

    * The following characters are now forbidden in separators, they
      interfer with regular expression matching:

            !#$%&'*+-.^`|~:\\\"

      (#10, #14).
