Welcome to the wordseg's documentation page
===========================================

The wordseg package provides **a collection of tools for text based
word segmentation** covering both algorithms, evaluation and
statistics relevent for word segmentation studies.

The segmentation algorithms available are ag, dibs, dpseg, puddle and
tp (see :ref:`algorithms`).  We provide a set of usefull commands for
text preparation, segmentation and evaluation than be used in
conjunction to any other bash utilities (see :ref:`commands`). The
package can also be used as a Python library (see :ref:`python`).

We provide as well an :ref:`installation` guide and a :ref:`tutorial`
to help you getting in. The **wordseg** package is a free software
made for open science, we welcome all the contributions (see
:ref:`contributing`).
