Welcome to the wordseg's documentation page
===========================================

The wordseg package provides **a collection of tools for text based
word segmentation** covering both text preprocessing, segmentation
algorithms, evaluation and statistics relevant for word segmentation
studies. It can be used from **bash** and **python**.

The segmentation algorithms available are ag, dibs, dpseg, puddle and
tp (see :ref:`algorithms`).  We provide a set of usefull commands for
text preparation, segmentation and evaluation than be used in
conjunction to any other bash utilities (see :ref:`commands`). The
package can also be used as a Python library (see :ref:`python`).

We provide an :ref:`installation` guide and a :ref:`tutorial` to help
you getting in. The **wordseg** package is a free software made for
open science, we welcome all the contributions (see
:ref:`contributing`).
