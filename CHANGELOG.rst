  under restrictive licence).

* Simplified output in **wordseg-stats**, removed redundancy, renamed
  'uniques' to 'hapaxes'. See #18.

* Bugfix in **wordseg-tp -t relative** when the last utterance of a
  text is made of a single phone. See #25.

* Bugfix in **wordseg-dpseg** when loading parameters from a configuration file

wordseg-0.6
-----------

* Features

  * New methods for basic statistics and normalized segmentation
    entropy in **wordseg-stats**

  * New forward/backward option in **wordseg-tp**.

  * New command **wordseg-baseline** that produces a random
    segmentation given the probability of a word boundary. If an
    oracle text is provided, the probability of word boundary is
    estimated from that text.

  * New command **wordseg-syll** estimates syllable boundaries on a
    text using the maximal onset principle. Exemples of onsets and
    vowels files for syllabifications are given in the directory
    `data/syllabification`.

  * Support for punctuation in input of **wordseg-prep** with the
    ``--punctuation`` option (#10).

    each wordseg release.

  * Improved documentation.

      interfer with regular expression matching::

        !#$%&'*+-.^`|~:\\\"

    * Type scoring is now correctly implemented in **wordseg-eval**
      (#10, #14).
